# MR-Class

This repository contains a deep learning application for efficient, automatic classification of MR sequences. 
MR-Classifier (MR-Class) is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method that can distinguish between six classes - T1 weighted (w), constrast-enhanced T1w, T2w, FLAIR, ADC and SWI. It consists of 6 ResNet classifiers, each identifying a single sequence.
